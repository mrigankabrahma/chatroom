## Anonymous Chat App

A Realtime Chat App which allows multiple users to join and chat anonymously. Built using Node and Socket.io

This app uses the Web Socket API which allows bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

The user after choosing a username can connect and chat anonymously with multiple users in real-time..

## Optimizations
While improving this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. Creating multiple chat groups
   2. Handling mobile phone users
   3. Implement more features and provide more options for the user
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned how to integrate an API into a project and how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to create a chat app project. I learned about the WebSocket API which is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. I learned how to use Socket.io library which is an event-driven JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
